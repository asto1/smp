The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon displayed in the browser tab. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as "favicon.ico" in the specified directory.

To create a favicon, you can use an online favicon generator or design your own icon using graphic design software. Once you have your favicon, save it in the following path:

/smp-maarif-nu-dukuhwaru-website/smp-maarif-nu-dukuhwaru-website/public/favicon.ico

If you need further assistance with the favicon design or any other part of the project, feel free to ask!
